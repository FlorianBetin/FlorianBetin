##  :boom: Welcome on my junior github profile, I'm Florian BÃ©tin :boom:

After several years as a content producer and artist team director, I've decided to aquire more technical knowledge to boost my career! That's why I'm currently training at the Wild Code School to become a FullStack Web Developer, even though I feel like I prefer Back-end ðŸ’—

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently learning these languages:
-HTML
-CSS
-PHP
-JAVASCRIPT

And I'm using mainly this framework:
-SYMPHONY

:grin: But soon, if I get my internship and continue my training, I'll learn ðŸ‘Š:
- React.js/node.js
