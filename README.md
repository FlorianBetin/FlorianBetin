### Welcome on my junior github profile, I'm Florian BÃ©tin ðŸ‘‹

After several years as a content producer and artist team director, I've decided to aquire more technical knowledge to boost my career! That's why I'm currently training at the Wild Code School to become a FullStack Web Developer. 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently learning these languages:
HTML/CSS/PHP/JAVASCRIPT/SYMPHONY/TWIG

:grin: But soon, if I get my internship and continue my training, I'll learn:
React.jd/node.js
